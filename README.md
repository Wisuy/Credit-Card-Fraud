# Credit Card Fraud Detection: Model & Sampling Comparison

This project is a **Master's degree assignment** focused on evaluating various machine learning strategies to handle highly imbalanced data. 

### Project Overview
The core objective is to compare different methodologies for achieving optimal fraud detection results, specifically focusing on:
* **Model Comparison:** Evaluating Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.
* **Imbalance Handling:** Comparative analysis of **Random Under-Sampling (RUS)** vs. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Integrating an **Isolation Forest** as a feature engineering step.

### Dataset
The analysis is based on the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud), which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
